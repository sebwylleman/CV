## Work Experience

### Profiles Personnel - Hospitality Events Staff (2022 to current)

My role at Profiles Personnel in sports event hospitality has been a training ground for the fast-paced, multifaceted world of DevOps.  The role demanded a diverse skillset that directly translates to the needs of a DevOps engineer:

**Generalist Mindset & Adaptability**: I wore many hats, leading catering teams, ensuring seamless service delivery, and managing inventory control to prevent stockouts. This experience honed my ability to learn various tools and procedures quickly, adapting to changing situations on the fly. It's a crucial skill for DevOps engineers who need to be agile by tackling various problems across different areas of the Software Development life cycle. 

**Example**: During a large-scale sporting event with multiple concession stands, we encountered a sudden surge in demand for a specific beverage that threatened to deplete our stock. By quickly analysing real-time inventory data and collaborating with logistics personnel, I identified an under-stocked stand with an excess of a similar product. I coordinated the transfer of surplus stock between stands, ensuring uninterrupted service and preventing customer frustration. This proactive approach minimised disruption and ensured a smooth customer experience throughout the event.

### My Tannour - Line Cook** (2021 to 2022)

While seemingly unrelated, my experience as a Line Cook surprisingly aligns with DevOps principles:

**Attention to Detail & Clear Communication**: Following recipes precisely and meticulously documenting steps mirrors the importance of scripting in DevOps. Both require a keen eye for detail and clear instructions to ensure consistent, high-quality results.
  
**Example**: By creating a detailed prep schedule that batched similar tasks for each menu item, I reduced prep time by an average of 15%. This allowed the kitchen staff to focus on maintaining quality and efficiency during peak service hour

## Education

### Makers Academy - Software Engineering (03/2023 to 06/2023)

In my intensive MERN stack web development bootcamp at Makers Academy, I embarked on an accelerated journey into the world of software engineering. This immersive program condensed months of learning into a focused curriculum, equipping me with the technical skills to build modern web applications from the ground up. Through hands-on projects, I gained a strong foundation in both front-end (React.js) and back-end (Node.js & MongoDB) development. 

Beyond technical expertise, the bootcamp fostered essential skills like **problem-solving**, **collaboration**, and navigating the **agile** development workflow. This training provided me with a solid foundation in web development.

## Hobbies

Here are some of my favourite:

Playing **tennis**: I'm a big fan of racket sports, and there's nothing quite like the rush of adrenaline that comes with a friendly game. Although I must admit my serve does need some work!

I am also into **cooking**, I've been channelling my inner Gordon Ramsay and diving headfirst into the world of cooking. Watching him on TV as a kid left a lasting impression, and I've been curious about trying new recipes and techniques ever since. Let's face it, not every dish I prepare meets the mark, but I'm proud to say the fire alarm remains silentâ€”for now, at least.
