## Sebastien Wylleman

Hello, I'm Seb, and I am currently exploring opportunities in entry-level software engineering positions. I have a strong interest in server-side development and core computer science subjects such as algorithms & data structures, resource management, and design patterns. I have experience working with various languages including C, Go, Python, and JavaScript. I look forward to engaging in discussions about how I can contribute to your team.

## Work Experience

**Profiles Personnel** (Sep-2022 to current)

In my role in sports event hospitality, I have gained valuable experience that directly translates to software engineering:

- Collaborated with a team to ensure seamless event execution, demonstrating strong teamwork and communication skills.
- Thrived in a fast-paced environment, managing time effectively and keeping a positive attitude during high-intensity events.
- Provided exceptional customer service, enhancing the guest experience through personalized interactions and problem-solving.
- Conducted post-event evaluations to identify areas for improvement, contributing to ongoing process enhancement and efficiency.

These experiences have honed my ability to work effectively in teams, meet deadlines, think creatively, and solve problems. I am confident that these skills will be highly valuable in the field of software engineering, where collaboration, innovation, and problem-solving are essential for success.

**01 Founders** (09-2022 to 10-2022)  

As a student at 01 Founders, I thrived under pressure with weekly exams and weekend group pairing work. Despite having only two weeks of coding experience, I challenged myself to create a Sudoku game. The program emphasized fundamental skills and thinking algorithmically, which encouraged me to use visual aids like diagrams and flow charts to problem-solve.

The experience provided me with an excellent introduction to programming and allowed me to develop technical skills in Go, as well as my collaboration, communication, and version control skills. I found mentorship by some students who were more experienced, but I equally mentored others, which cemented my knowledge.

The absence of coaches and lectures encouraged peer-to-peer learning and seeking help from fellow students. Completing a set of challenges each day while googling or asking around for help from other students doing the same exercises was our day-to-day routine.

Overall, the 01 Founders program was a valuable experience that helped me develop my technical skills, collaboration, communication, and version control skills while providing an introduction to programming.

## Skills

#### Communication

My experience in hospitality and retail has allowed me to develop excellent communication skills that I believe will be highly valuable in software development. For example, as a sales associate, I learned to use active listening skills to identify customer needs and provide personalized solutions. Additionally, working in hospitality for sporting events taught me to communicate effectively with diverse customers, adapting my style to different situations and personalities.

These skills have also been useful in my training to be a developer, where I led a session on using agile methodologies to improve team collaboration and project outcomes. I provided clear explanations and examples, ensuring that all participants understood the concepts.

Ultimately, I have developed the ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of individuals, from customers to colleagues to technical experts. I prioritize active listening, clear and concise communication, and providing concrete examples to support my points. I am confident that these skills will be an asset in any future roles that require effective communication.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (03/2023 to 06/2023)

Makers is a highly selective coding bootcamp teaching Software Development in 12 weeks. Focusing on Test Driven Development, with an emphasis on pair programming and working in an agile way including daily stand-ups, retrospectives, and iterative development. A highly collaborative environment helped me to develop not only my technical skills but also my ability to work in a team and communicate effectively with others.


Acquired further skills in:

- **Test Driven Development:** Gained practical experience in writing tests before writing code, with a strong emphasis on pair programming. Developed skills in creating test suites, implementing test cases, and using TDD to drive software design and development.

- **Object-oriented programming:** Acquired a solid understanding of OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Demonstrated proficiency in applying these concepts to create reusable, modular, and maintainable code.

- **Model-View-Controller framework patterns:** Developed experience in using MVC patterns to design and develop web applications. Gained knowledge of how to separate concerns and responsibilities between models, views, and controllers to create scalable and maintainable code.

- **Independent learning and problem-solving:** Cultivated skills in researching, analyzing, and solving complex problems independently. Developed the ability to learn new technologies, tools, and frameworks quickly and efficiently, while maintaining a high level of attention to detail.

#### Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle de Londres (Sep 2005 - Jun 2011)

At the end of my secondary school education I obtained my French Baccalaureate (A-levels equivalent).

- _Baccalauréat Général_ in Social Sciences and Economics.
- Specialiased in Maths and Modern Greek.
  
## Hobbies

Here are a some of my favourites:

- Playing tennis and football: I'm a big fan of team sports, and there's nothing quite like the rush of adrenaline that comes with a good match. Plus, staying active is a key part of my lifestyle.
  
- Cooking, I've been channeling my inner Gordon Ramsay and diving headfirst into the world of cooking. Watching him on TV as a kid definitely left a lasting impression, and I've been curious with trying out new recipes and techniques ever since. But let's be honest, not every dish I make is up to par. Sometimes I don't quite hit the mark, and my poor guests have to suffer through it. We all have our moments, right? So, bear with me as I continue to whip up surprises in the kitchen.
