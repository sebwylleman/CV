_A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech._

Hello there! I am a curious and determined individual with a newfound passion for software engineering. I have had experience working in hospitality where I honed my customer service and problem-solving skills, which have proven to be invaluable in my current role. Although I love whipping up tasty dishes in the kitchen, building innovative tech products and tools is equally exciting. The prospect of combining my passions for food and tech to create something unique is truly inspiring.

As a software engineer, I am eager to explore and experiment with my love for culinary arts and incorporate it into my work. The opportunity to develop products that improve user experience, drive innovation, and facilitate collaboration is what motivates me to continue exploring the endless possibilities in this field. Collaborating with like-minded individuals to build exceptional products is an exciting prospect that I look forward to. Check out my day-to-day updates here to learn more about my journey in tech.

_Draft_

- Talk about 01F founders pool and how you thrived under pressure with weekly exams, weekend group pairing work. I remember struggling on creating a Sudoku game after only 2 weeks of coding experience.
  The weekly exams without internet forced me to double down on my fundamentals as there was no access to the internet or other help. Same goes with Go librairies, we weren't allowed to use any functions other than how to print a character. That got us thinking algorithmically a lot, I recall using drawing diagrams,s and flow charts or scribbling down things, as I find that seeing things visualy helped me greatly to problem solve. Overall it was a great experience that I highly recommend to anyone who wants to get a glimpse of this world learning software engineering. The event provided me with an excellent introduction to programming, and allowed me to develop my technical skills in Go, as well as my collaboration, communication, and version control skills. It was valuable to be in a group of individuals of all skillsets, I found mentorship by some students who were more experienced, but I equally mentored others so that was good to really cement my knowledge as 1 month is a short time to learn any skill. Forgot to mention that there weren't any coaches to seek help from, no were there lectures. Our day to day involved peer to peer learning by completing a set of challenges each day, whilst googling or asking around for help from other students doing the same exercises.
  I am proud that I finised amongst the top performers and was offered a place on the 2 year full-time learning programme. However I felt that I could find employment sooner with Makers so that's the final choice that I made. never thought that I would be semi decent at this, as I hadn't done that kind of math logic in years.

## Skills

\_Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had\_

#### Communication

My experience in hospitality and retail has allowed me to develop excellent communication skills that I believe will be highly valuable in software development. For example, as a sales associate, I learned to use active listening skills to identify customer needs and provide personalized solutions. Additionally, working in hospitality for sporting events taught me to communicate effectively with diverse customers, adapting my style to different situations and personalities.

These skills have also been useful in my training to be a developer, where I led a session on using agile methodologies to improve team collaboration and project outcomes. I provided clear explanations and examples, ensuring that all participants understood the concepts.

Ultimately, I have developed the ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of individuals, from customers to colleagues to technical experts. I prioritize active listening, clear and concise communication, and providing concrete examples to support my points. I am confident that these skills will be an asset in any future roles that require effective communication.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill

## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)

- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below:
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### 01 Founders Immersive Pool (Sep 2022 - Oct 2022)

Introduction to programming in a 1 month peer to peer programming in person event with daily challenges to complete in Go. During the peer-to-peer programming event, I:

- Completed daily programming challenges in Go, which helped me to develop my problem-solving skills.
- Collaborated with other participants to debug and optimize our code, which improved my teamwork and communication skills.
- Used Git and Command Line to manage and track changes to our code, which improved my version control skills.

Overall, the event provided me with an excellent introduction to programming, and allowed me to develop my technical skills in Go, as well as my collaboration, communication, and version control skills.

#### Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle de Londres(Sep 2005 - Jun 2011)

At the end of my secondary school education I obtained my French Baccalaureate (A-levels equivalent).

- _Baccalauréat Général_ in Social Sciences and Economics.Grade C overall.
- Specialiased in Maths and Modern Greek. Grades A for both.
