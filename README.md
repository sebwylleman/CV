## Sebastien Wylleman

Hello, I'm Seb, and I am currently exploring opportunities in entry-level software engineering positions. I have a strong interest in server-side development and core computer science subjects such as algorithms & data structures, resource management, and design patterns. I have experience working with various languages including C, Go, Python, and JavaScript. I look forward to engaging in discussions about how I can contribute to your team.

## Work Experience

**Profiles Personnel** (Sep-2022 to current)

In my role in sports event hospitality, I have gained valuable experience that directly translates to software engineering:

- Collaborated with a team to ensure seamless event execution, demonstrating strong teamwork and communication skills.
- Thrived in a fast-paced environment, managing time effectively and keeping a positive attitude during high-intensity events.
- Provided exceptional customer service, enhancing the guest experience through personalized interactions and problem-solving.
- Conducted post-event evaluations to identify areas for improvement, contributing to ongoing process enhancement and efficiency.

These experiences have honed my ability to work effectively in teams, meet deadlines, think creatively, and solve problems. I am confident that these skills will be highly valuable in the field of software engineering, where collaboration, innovation, and problem-solving are essential for success.

**01 Founders** (09-2022 to 10-2022)  


As a student at 01 Founders, I thrived under pressure with weekly exams and weekend group pairing work. Despite having only two weeks of coding experience, I challenged myself to create a Sudoku game. The program emphasized fundamental skills and thinking algorithmically, which encouraged me to use visual aids like diagrams and flow charts to problem-solve.

The experience provided me with an excellent introduction to programming and allowed me to develop technical skills in Go, as well as my collaboration, communication, and version control skills. I found mentorship by some students who were more experienced, but I equally mentored others, which cemented my knowledge.

The absence of coaches and lectures encouraged peer-to-peer learning and seeking help from fellow students. Completing a set of challenges each day while googling or asking around for help from other students doing the same exercises was our day-to-day routine.

I finished among the top performers and was offered a place in the 2-year full-time learning program. However, I decided to pursue employment sooner with Makers. The experience taught me that I could become proficient in math logic despite not having practiced it for years.

Overall, the 01 Founders program was a valuable experience that helped me develop my technical skills, collaboration, communication, and version control skills while providing an introduction to programming.

## Skills

\_Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had\_

#### Communication

My experience in hospitality and retail has allowed me to develop excellent communication skills that I believe will be highly valuable in software development. For example, as a sales associate, I learned to use active listening skills to identify customer needs and provide personalized solutions. Additionally, working in hospitality for sporting events taught me to communicate effectively with diverse customers, adapting my style to different situations and personalities.

These skills have also been useful in my training to be a developer, where I led a session on using agile methodologies to improve team collaboration and project outcomes. I provided clear explanations and examples, ensuring that all participants understood the concepts.

Ultimately, I have developed the ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of individuals, from customers to colleagues to technical experts. I prioritize active listening, clear and concise communication, and providing concrete examples to support my points. I am confident that these skills will be an asset in any future roles that require effective communication.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)

- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below:
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### 01 Founders Immersive Pool (Sep 2022 - Oct 2022)

Introduction to programming in a 1 month peer to peer programming in person event with daily challenges to complete in Go. During the peer-to-peer programming event, I:

- Completed daily programming challenges in Go, which helped me to develop my problem-solving skills.
- Collaborated with other participants to debug and optimize our code, which improved my teamwork and communication skills.
- Used Git and Command Line to manage and track changes to our code, which improved my version control skills.

Overall, the event provided me with an excellent introduction to programming, and allowed me to develop my technical skills in Go, as well as my collaboration, communication, and version control skills.

#### Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle de Londres(Sep 2005 - Jun 2011)

At the end of my secondary school education I obtained my French Baccalaureate (A-levels equivalent).

- _Baccalauréat Général_ in Social Sciences and Economics.Grade C overall.
- Specialiased in Maths and Modern Greek. Grades A for both.

## Hobbies

In my free time, I enjoy pursuing a variety of interests that keep me active and engaged. Some of my favorite hobbies include:

- Playing tennis and football: I love the challenge and excitement of team sports, and staying active is an important part of my lifestyle.
- Learning how to cook: I enjoy experimenting with new recipes and techniques, and I find the process of preparing and sharing meals to be incredibly rewarding.
- Exploring new places: Whether it's traveling to a new city or simply discovering a hidden gem in my own neighborhood, I love to explore and learn about different cultures and experiences and being able to share this with my friends and family.
