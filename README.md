## Work Experience

### Profiles Personnel - Hospitality Events Staff (2022 to current)

My role at Profiles Personnel in sports event hospitality has been a training ground for the fast-paced, multifaceted world of DevOps.  The role demanded a diverse skillset that directly translates to the needs of a DevOps engineer:

**Generalist Mindset & Adaptability**: I wore many hats, leading catering teams, ensuring seamless service delivery, and managing inventory control to prevent stockouts. This experience honed my ability to learn various tools and procedures quickly, adapting to changing situations on the fly. It's a crucial skill for DevOps engineers who need to be agile by tackling various problems across different areas of the Software Development life cycle. 

**Example**: During a large-scale sporting event with multiple concession stands, we encountered a sudden surge in demand for a specific beverage that threatened to deplete our stock. By quickly analysing real-time inventory data and collaborating with logistics personnel, I identified an under-stocked stand with an excess of a similar product. I coordinated the transfer of surplus stock between stands, ensuring uninterrupted service and preventing customer frustration. This proactive approach minimised disruption and ensured a smooth customer experience throughout the event.

### My Tannour - Cook (2021 to 2022)

While seemingly unrelated, my experience as a Line Cook surprisingly aligns with DevOps principles:

**Attention to Detail & Clear Communication**: Following recipes precisely and meticulously documenting steps mirrors the importance of scripting in DevOps. Both require a keen eye for detail and clear instructions to ensure consistent, high-quality results.
  
**Example**: By creating a detailed prep schedule that batched similar tasks for each menu item, I reduced prep time by an average of 25%. This allowed the kitchen staff to focus on maintaining quality and efficiency during peak service hours.

## Education

### Makers Academy - Software Engineering (03/2023 to 06/2023)

Makers Academy's intensive 12-week coding bootcamp fast-tracked my entry into software engineering. This immersive program packed months of learning into a focused curriculum, giving me the skills to build modern web apps from scratch. Hands-on projects solidified my foundation in both front-end (React.js) and back-end (Node.js & MongoDB).

Beyond technical expertise, the bootcamp fostered essential skills like **problem-solving**, **collaboration**, and navigating the **agile** development workflow. This training provided me with a solid foundation in web development.

## Hobbies

Playing **Tennis**: Attempting to keep the ball inside the court, often resulting in more laughs than points scored. Embracing the joy of the game without taking myself too seriously.

Exploring **my local tech meetups**: Dabbling in the world of Linux, Go and Systems Engineering. Sometimes getting lost in the terminal and accidentally breaking things. I like to attend local user groups to mingle with fellow enthusiasts and marvel at their expertise, all while secretly hoping no one notices my occasional tech mishaps.
