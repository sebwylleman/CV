*A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.*

Hey there, I'm a curious and determined individual with a newfound passion for software engineering. As much as I love whipping up a good dish in the kitchen, I find building tech products and tools just as exciting. After all, what's cooler than being able to blend my two passions - food and tech - and build something that's both innovative and delicious? 

I've had some experience working in the world of retail and hospitality, but it was only when I started tinkering with software products that I knew I had found my calling. Being able to create something that has the potential to improve user experience, drive innovation, and facilitate collaboration is a feeling like no other. 

As a software engineer, I'm thrilled about the endless opportunities to explore and experiment with my passion for culinary arts. I mean, who knows what kind of amazing product I could build that would combine my love of food with the latest tech? And, even better, I can connect with others who share my interests and collaborate to make something truly amazing.

So, if you're looking for someone with a unique blend of skills and interests, look no further. I'm ready to bring my passion for software engineering and culinary arts to the table and build something truly extraordinary.

As a software developer, I am committed to applying these skills to deliver quality results and collaborate effectively with team members to achieve success.


## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill


## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### 01 Founders Immersive Pool (Sep 2022 - Oct 2022)
Introduction to programming in a 1 month peer to peer programming in person event with daily challenges to complete in Go. During the peer-to-peer programming event, I:

- Completed daily programming challenges in Go, which helped me to develop my problem-solving skills.
- Collaborated with other participants to debug and optimize our code, which improved my teamwork and communication skills.
- Used Git and Command Line to manage and track changes to our code, which improved my version control skills.

Overall, the event provided me with an excellent introduction to programming, and allowed me to develop my technical skills in Go, as well as my collaboration, communication, and version control skills.

#### Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle de Londres(Sep 2005 - Jun 2011)
At the end of my secondary school education I obtained my French Baccalaureate (A-levels equivalent).
- *Baccalauréat Général* in Social Sciences and Economics.Grade C overall.
- Specialiased in Maths and Modern Greek. Grades A for both.
