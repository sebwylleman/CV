## About me

Hello! I'm Seb, a Makers Academy graduate with a passion for automation and optimising systems. My background in hospitality honed valuable skills like attention to detail, collaboration, and problem-solving, which I believe translate perfectly to the DevOps mindset.

## Work Experience

#### Profiles Personnel - Hospitality Events Staff (2022 to current)

My role at Profiles Personnel in sports event hospitality has been a training ground for the fast-paced, multifaceted world of DevOps.  The role demanded a diverse skillset that directly translates to the needs of a DevOps engineer:

**Generalist Mindset & Adaptability**: I wore many hats, leading catering teams, ensuring seamless service delivery, and managing inventory control to prevent stockouts. This experience honed my ability to learn various tools and procedures quickly, adapting to changing situations on the fly. It's a crucial skill for DevOps engineers who need to be agile by tackling various problems across different areas of the Software Development life cycle. 

**Example**: During a large-scale sporting event with multiple concession stands, we encountered a sudden surge in demand for a specific beverage that threatened to deplete our stock. By quickly analysing real-time inventory data and collaborating with logistics personnel, I identified an under-stocked stand with excess of a similar drink. I coordinated the transfer of surplus stock between stands, ensuring uninterrupted service and preventing customer frustration. This proactive approach minimised disruption and ensured a smooth customer experience throughout the event.

#### My Tannour - Line Cook** (2021 to 2022)

While seemingly unrelated, my experience as a Line Cook surprisingly aligns with DevOps principles:

**Attention to Detail & Clear Communication**: Following recipes precisely and meticulously documenting steps mirrors the importance of scripting in DevOps. Both require a keen eye for detail and clear instructions to ensure consistent, high-quality results.
  
**Example**: By creating a detailed prep schedule that batched similar tasks for each menu item, I reduced prep time by an average of 15%. This allowed the kitchen staff to focus on maintaining quality and efficiency during peak service hour

## Education

#### Makers Academy (03/2023 to 06/2023)

**Makers** is a highly selective coding bootcamp teaching Software Engineering in 12 weeks. Focusing on Test Driven Development, with an emphasis on pair programming and working in an agile way including daily stand-ups, retrospectives, and iterative development. A highly collaborative environment helped me to develop not only my technical skills but also my ability to work in a team and communicate effectively with others.

Acquired further skills in:

**Test Driven Development**: Gained practical experience in writing tests before writing code, with a strong emphasis on pair programming. Developed skills in creating test suites, implementing test cases, and using TDD to drive software design and development.

**Object-oriented programming**: Acquired a solid understanding of OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Demonstrated proficiency in applying these concepts to create reusable, modular, and maintainable code.

**Independent learning and problem-solving**: Cultivated skills in researching, analysing, and solving complex problems independently. Developed the ability to learn new technologies, tools, and frameworks quickly and efficiently, while maintaining a high level of attention to detail.
  
## Hobbies

Here are a some of my favourite:

Playing **tennis**: I'm a big fan of racket sports, and there's nothing quite like the rush of adrenaline that comes with a friendly game. Although I must admit my serve does need some work!
I am also into **cooking**, I've been channeling my inner Gordon Ramsay and diving headfirst into the world of cooking. Watching him on TV as a kid definitely left a lasting impression, and I've been curious with trying out new recipes and techniques ever since. Let's face it, not every dish I prepare meets the mark, but I'm proud to say the fire alarm remains silentâ€”for now, at least.
